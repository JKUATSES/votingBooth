### Become an JKUAT SES Voting Booth Triager

You can help us manage our issue tracker! All you need is enough familiarity with JKUAT SES Voting Booth to try and reproduce bugs. We triage issues by having conversations with the issue creator and then either closing the issue or moving it into the [Bugs](https://github.com/JKUATSES/votingBooth/milestones/Bugs) or [Features](https://github.com/JKUATSES/votingBooth/milestones/Features) milestone. We use these buckets as the backlogs for our upcoming releases.

We use this "algorithm" for triaging issues, which anyone can jump in and follow:

1. If issue is a feature request, discuss amongst JKUAT SES Voting Booth devs.
    * If we decide to build it, add to the Features milestone.
    * If we decide not to build it, just close.
2. If issue is a bug report, attempt to verify
    * If it's a duplicate, close with link to bug already reported.
    * If it ultimately can't be verified, close until we have enough information to verify (e.g., in most cases we need a full set of JKUAT SES Voting Booth logs to help diagnose an issue).
    * If the user hasn't provided enough information, keep asking for enough information to verify.
    * If it's a verified new bug, add it to the Bugs milestone.
    * If we have been waiting for a reply from the user for over 3 weeks, close.
