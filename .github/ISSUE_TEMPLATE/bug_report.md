Provide a (link to a) minimal demo app showing the faulty behaviour.

Provide a code sample with a bunch of magic parameters which I need to interpolate by guessing to reconstruct the actual runtime code.

#### Worst :poop:
Say the source code can't be disclosed and refuse to provide any of the above. Expect this issue to be closed by a bunch of angry aliens :alien::alien::alien::alien::alien: that will hunt you down and :fire: your :computer:. You've been warned. :fire_engine:
